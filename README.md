# Word2Vec notebooks for DataNights NLP cohorts

Notebooks for my session on Word2Vec for DataHack's DataNights program.

The Word2Vec exercise can be found in ``DataNights_2020_Word2Vec_ex0.ipynb``, and the school solution in ``DataNights_2020_Word2Vec_ex0_school_solution.ipynb``.

Additionally, ``Word2vec_BBC_news.ipynb`` provides a nice and self-contained demo of using the ``gensim`` implementation of Word2Vec.
